                    The first thing that should come to my mind is this <i>excellent</i> resistance to corrosion,
                    <br>
                    <b>BUT</b>,
                    <br>
                    only at <i>room temperature</i>. Recall that \(\ce{Ti}\) also has excellent resistance to corrosion; and this is independent of temperature

                    Remember <i>room temperature</i>!
                    <br>
                    Recall regarding "room temperature", that \(\ce{Cr}\) would get oxidized to \(\ce{Cr2O3}\) by \(\ce{O2}\) at room temperature

                    Alloys with \(\ce{V}\) are made by adding \(\ce{V}\) to steel; this point is kind of an extension of this fact.
                    <br>
                    Try to correlate the previous point about alloys, to this point, which is about what happens when a small quantity of \(\ce{V}\) is added to steel

                    I kind of seem to forget this point, about \(\ce{V2O5}\).

                    This popup is just to remind you that it's there! And just so you're here, there's also a point about \(\ce{Mn}\)--the fact that it is electropositive--sthat you kept forgetting
