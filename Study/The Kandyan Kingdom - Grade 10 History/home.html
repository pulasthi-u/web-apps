                The Kingdom is Established
            </span>
            <p>
                The Kandyan Kingdom was first established by a King known as King Sena Sammatha Wikramabahu. It is he, who is considered to the founder of the Kingdom. Before being established as a separate kingdom, it existed as a provincial ruling unit belonging to the Kotte Kingdom, under King Parakramabahu VI.
            </p>
            <p>
                King Sena Sammatha Wikramabahu's successor was his son, who became king as King Jayaweera Bandara. This king ruled the country for about 40 years, from 1511 to 1551. After King Jayaweera Bandara's ruling period finished, his son ascended to the throne, as King Karaliyadde Bandara. It is during the period of King Karaliyadde Bandara that things begin to get interesting.

                The Kingdom Grows
            </span>
            <p>
                During the period of King Jayaweera Bandara in Kandy, and King Weera Parakramabahu VIII in Kotte, in the year 1505, the Portuguese had arrived in the country. King Karaliyadde who came to power after King Jayaweera Bandara maintained a friendly policy with the Portuguese in the country. However, the Kandyan people were not happy with this policy of his. Therefore, they decided to ignore the king, and to support King Rajasinghe I, who was the then ruler of the Kingdom of Seethawaka. Additionally, King Rajasinghe also saw Kandy as a challenge to his own kingdom Seethawa, and had the intention of capturing it as well.
            </p>
            <p>
               Due to all these reasons, Kandy was invaded and captured in 1580 by King Rajasinghe I. King Karaliyadde Bandara, who could not stand the invasions of Seethawaka, fled to the Portuguese, along with his daughter and son-in-law, expecting to find protection there. The Portuguese saw this as a good opportunity for them to spread their power in the country. They got them to convert to their religion, and treated them well expecting to obtain assistance from them later on. Accordingly, King Karaliyadde's daughter, Kusumasana Devi, was baptized as Dona Catherina, and his son-in-law, Yamasinghe Bandara, was baptized as Don Phillip.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, there was a Kandyan Chieftain called Peradeniye Weerasundara Bandara, who assisted King Rajasinghe I to capture Kandy in 1580. While the King was ruling Kandy remotely, from Seethawaka, he suspected Weerasundara Bandara for certain reasons, and killed him tactfully. Weerasundara Bandara had a son named Konappu Bandara. When his father was killed, he fled to the Portuguese. There, he too was baptized as Don Juan of Austria. Him too, the Portuguese saw as an opportunity, and kept him with them expecting to obtain assistance later on. But little did the Portuguese know about what exactly he wanted to do by himself.

                King Wimaladharmasuriya I
            </span>
            <p>
                At this moment, Kandy was being ruled remotely by King Rajasinghe I of Seethawaka. However, this time, the chieftains of Kandy were not satisfied with the policies of King Rajasinghe I. The Portuguese took this to their opportunity. They had with them a person who had the legal right to the Kandyan throne, whom they could use as a puppet ruler of theirs. King Karaliyadde Bandara's son-in-law, or his daughter's husband, Yamasinghe Bandara. The Portuguese sent him to Kandy and made him the king there, expecting to have a kingdom loyal to them in the country. Accordingly, Yamasinghe Bandara was sent to Kandy, along with an army led by Konappu Bandara for him protection, and was made king there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ruling period of Yamasinghe Bandara was quite short. He passed away soon. The next expectation of the Portuguese was to make the youngest son of Yamasinghe Bandara the king of Kandy. Unexpectedly, Konappu Bandara got in their way; he betrayed them. The Portuguese expected Konappu Bandara to be loyal to them. Konappu Bandara betraying them was a huge blow to them. Konappu Bandara, with the assistance of the Kandyan people, became the next king of Kandy, as King Wimaladharmasuriya I, in the year 1591. Here, we see that he had had a real love for his country, and did not want it to be in the hands of a foreign nation. The way he tactfully acted to fulfill this aspiration of his, by first appearing to be loyal to the Portuguese is quite appreciable.
            </p>
            <p>
                When King Wimaladharmasuriya became the king of Kandy, he had a lot of challenges to face. In the first place, he had no legal right to the throne; he was a complete outsider without any royal inheritance. Then, there were many threats to Kandy from the Portuguese; which were probably further aggravated due to Konappu Bandara betraying the Portuguese. There were also threats to Kandy by King Rajasinghe I of Seethawaka, who probably did not like to see another kingdom flourish in the country, and surpass the power of his. Yet again, the state of religion, economy and society of Kandy at this time had declined to a very great extent, and the King had to uplift it. The king successfully overcame each of these challenges, and made Kandy yet another prosperous kingdom.

                    <li>
                        The king married Kusumasana Devi, or Dona Catherina, the daughter of King Karaliyadde Bandara, who had the legal right to the throne, and thereby established his own right to the throne. He then changed his foreign name -- Don Juan of Austria -- to a Sinhalese name as Wimaladharmasuriya. He took steps to bring the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha, which was then in the Temple of Delgamu, to Kandy; and through the relic establish his right to kingship. (In the ancient society, it was believed that the receipt to kingship in ancient Sri Lanka was the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha. Thus, the king had to possess the relic to be accepted as king.)

                    <li>
                        The king also successfully overcame the challenges he had to face due to the Portuguese. In the Battle of Danthure which took place in 1594 against the them, King Wimaladharmasuriya was able to defeat them completely. Additionally, when rebellions arose against the Portuguese in the low country regions, the king gave his support to them. He also sought assistance of Dutch to expel the Portuguese from the country. The first meeting Sri Lanka had with the Dutch was also during this King's period. It was in 1602, that Dutch governor Joris van Spilbergen met King Wimaladharmasuriya for discussions. The threat to Kandy from Seethawaka was successfully overcome by this king, by defeating King Rajasinghe I.

                    <li>
                        The king also took steps to uplift the state of Buddhism of the country. He took steps to bring Higher Ordination or Upasampada to the country from Myanmar, and also renovated temples such as Gadaldeniya, Ridee Viharaya and Lankathilake.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He took steps such as developing agriculture, cotton cultivation, and the nitre industry in Kandy, and the iron and steel industries in Kothmale and Walapane. This resulted in the uplifting of the economy of Kandy.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            These great services done by King Wimaladharmasuriya were really helpful for Sri Lanka to become an independent nation once again. The king passed away in 1604, due to a sudden fever, after ruling for 13 years.
