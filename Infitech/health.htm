Medical science has accelerated over the past few years to provide patients with more advanced applications for productive health..therefore scientists all over the world have enriched themselves to forward projects to accomplish this scenario..most inporatantly,scientists mainly focus on manufacturing devices to support the annihilation of diseases which cures are considered impossible.Moreover the standard of living of the people is strived to advance and develop....here you'll be directed to the major future technological devices which will leave you flabbergasted..but some of them may prove to be hypothetical and theoretical but rest assured not <i>imposssible</i>.

<font size=10>Recreational cyborgs<br></font>
<i><font size=3>The contraption which eases living for the disabled</font></i>
<br>
Recreational cyborgs forward the idea of prosthetics which provide artificial aid for the disabled community making it possible for them to perform their daily activities as normal persons. This may seem as an anomaly but it is possible to provide this remedy for community considered inferior in the society. They are equipped to aid the people with every possible action that they are urged to do.Most imporatantly these cyborgs are highly advanced and do not  influence the society to think of the disabled as inferior and neglectable. Cyborgs are highly equipped to perform the normal activities of a normal person. Therefore it can be used by all without worry. Also the technology of the cyborgs are over the top. However, cyborgs are highly expensive due to the advanced technology incorporated in the contraption and the high quality raw materials used to devleop the project.</p>

<br>
<i><font size=3>The brigde between reality and fascination.</font></i>
<br>
<p>Augmented reality is the way of which artificial graphics and animations can be overlayed over a real graphic taken seperately from our surrounding. Augmented Reality-AR for short-can be used in diagnosis of diseases by overlaying the condition of on-going diagnoses. For example, a model of a bone or a muscle can be overlayed on the natural, real picture. Or, a model of a pulmonary artery which carries oxygen from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs can be overlayed. AR accelerates convenience in the disease diagnosis process because it enables the construction of three-dimensional graphics which are overlayed on the natural picture so the artificial internal graphic of the organ in diagnosis can be done. However, AR also needs experience in interaction to achieve its full potential in work.</p>

<font size=10>Google Brain</font>
<br>
<font size=3><i>Aid for mental sanity</i></font>
<br>
Google Brain is theoretical conceptual application where one's mental sanity is boosted by the mutual transmission of nerve impulses to the cerebrum cortex of the brain...this too may sound as an anomaly but it can be done. Moreover through the google brain application the sequencial sanity attributes are produced to be in co-ordination. A main advantage of Google Brain is that it accelerates co-ordination mentally to perform the daily tasks simultaneously monitoring the on and off funtions of the brain which as mentioned before. But, Google Brain's theoretical apporach makes it an anomaly also hard to configure the conditions necessary to produce the Google Brain in its manifacturing aspects.</p>
