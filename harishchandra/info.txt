14 yrs (0 - 12) = Platinum
8 yrs (6 - 12) = Gold

NOTE: Grades shall be one-based; starting from 1, 1 inclusive, going upto 13, 13 inclusive

Let;

e = grade you were in, when you left school (1 - 13)
s = grade you were admitted to (1 - 13)
n = number of years you were in school [this can be obtained by (e-s)+1 ]

Thus;

Your member ranking shall be calculated by;

e^2 - e + n

Also equal to;

e^2 - s + 1
